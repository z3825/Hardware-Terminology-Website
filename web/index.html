	<h2>Input Device</h2>
	
	<p>In computing, an input device is a piece of equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or information appliance. Examples of input devices include keyboards, mouse, scanners, cameras, joysticks, and microphones.</p>

	<h2>Output Device</h2>
	
	<p>Computer output devices receive information from the computer, and carry data that has been processed by the computer to the user.  Output devices provide data in myriad different forms, some of which include audio, visual, and hard copy media.  The devices are usually used for display, projection, or for physical reproduction.  Monitors and printers are two of the most commonly-known output devices used with a computer.</p>

	<h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
	
	<p>Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor, the CPU (pronounced sea-pea-you) is the central processing unit of the computer. A computer's CPU handles all instructions it receives from hardware and software running on the computer. As an example, the CPU processed the instructions to use a web browser to open and display this web page on your computer.</p>

	<div>
	<h2>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h2>
	
	<p>In computing, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h2>Control Unit</h2>
	
	<p>During the execution of a program, the control unit fetches one instruction at a time from the main memory and then executes it. In this execution process, it takes help of ALU, if the instruction execution involves arithmetic or logical operation (like AND, OR, Ex-OR). After execution of the current instruction, the CPU fetches the next instruction for execution. </p>

	<h2>Random Access Memory</h2>
	
	<p>Random-access memory (RAM; /ræm/) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h2>Optical Memory</h2>
	
	<p>Optical memory is an electronic storage medium that uses a laser beam to store and retrieve the data. If we classify the memory system then optical memory comes under the external memory in the computer system. Optical memory can be classified into many types.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h2>Magnetic Memory</h2>
	
	<p>The limitations of primary storage devices like limited data storage capacity, high cost and volatile nature, some inexpensive data storage devices are needed to be used as additional memory, that has larger data storage capacity, low cost and is, non-volatile in nature. All these features are found in magnetic memory.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h2>Flash Memory</h2>
	
	<p>Electronic memory comes in a variety of forms to serve a variety of purposes. Flash memory is used for easy and fast information storage in computers, digital cameras and home video game consoles. It is used more like a hard drive than as RAM. In fact, flash memory is known as a solid state storage device, meaning there are no moving parts -- everything is electronic instead of mechanical.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h2>Logic Gates</h2>
	
	<p>A logic gate is an idealized model of computation or physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output. </p>
